# termbase16-vim

The Vim colorschemes from [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim)
are awesome, but in the terminal they require you to change your shell's
default ANSI colors, which affects not only Vim, but any other shell command
you run. This colorscheme repository fixes this by remapping each base16
colorscheme to use ANSI 256 color codes instead of the default 16 colors.
